# Time to start looking at the features
# Here is a visualization of the non-character variables
```{r readin}
library(readr)
#install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)

setwd("")
train <- read_csv("151013 Test Case.csv")

#train <- train[,-c(1)]

# Write to the log:
cat(sprintf("Training set has %d rows and %d columns\n", nrow(train), ncol(train)))
cat(sprintf("Test set has %d rows and %d columns\n", nrow(test), ncol(test)))

M <- cor(train[sapply(train, function(x) !is.character(x))])
#corrplot(M, method = "ellipse",order = "hclust")
##Updated
corrplot(M, method = "number",order = "hclust",type='lower', diag=F, addCoefasPercent=T)
