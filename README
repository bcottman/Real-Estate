Designed and developed several Rmd scripts (workbook format for R) to analyze 
and diagnose the Real Estate market of Alachua County. Data was captured 
from several web-sites, one of which was scraped (legally) and cleaned 
using R. Developed targeted mailing lists of most likely to buy or sell
where the primary variables turned out to be exponential distribution 
of time-to-last-sale and other dependent variables. Increased response 
rate from 0.2% to 1.2% (based on approximately 5,000 mailings distributed 
over control (1,000) and targeted groups (4,000).
